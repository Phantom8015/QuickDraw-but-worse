# QuickDraw but worse - This project is now deprecated

This is a Google QuickDraw style game that is.. definitely better than the original. 

## Description

This game is a fun way to test your drawing skills! You will be given freedom to draw whatever you want. The AI will be trying to guess what you have drawn with the help of the exponentially large QuickDraw dataset.
